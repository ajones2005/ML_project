This project uses machine learning models to predict NBA 2K26 overall player ratings based on advanced basketball analytics. By leveraging metrics such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Box Plus-Minus (BPM), and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), the project explores how closely NBA 2K player ratings align with real-world performance data.
Three regression models are evaluated:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
The results demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly XGBoost, are highly effective at approximating NBA 2K ratings.
